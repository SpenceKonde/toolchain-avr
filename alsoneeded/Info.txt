These need to replace the normal versions of these files - there doesn't appear to already be a way to do this - or it wasn't readily apparent to me (I see another version of eeprom.h in the avrlibc patches - but it doesn't get included in the packages that the build scripts generate- and a good thing that is too too, because it would be incompatible with megaAVR 0-series, tinyAVR 0-series and 1-series too). I've made a set of packages for my own use by assembling from windows kit (I couldn't get cross compiling working) but would love to see these get rolled in.


eeprom.h is from avr3.6.2.1759 (from microchip site) - it fixes the error when using eeprom_is_read() macro from this library.

power.h was from discussion on #66 and has been tested.

Have also included the modified linker scripts to fix #67.  This uses the slightly safer approach that was posted in one of those threads of making sure the symbol is defined before trying to use it, though I'm not sure how that could end up happening.

It's not clear to me which of the linker scripts, potentially, could possible end up being used - so this includes the linker scripts for all the tinyAVR 0-series, tinyAVR 1-series, megaAVR 0-series (avrxmega3) and the DA series parts (avrxmega4)
